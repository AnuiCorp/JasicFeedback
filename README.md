## Welcome to the Jasic Beta ##

We would like to invite you to try Jasic, a JavaScript development tool designed exclusively for the iPad.  Jasic is a labor of love by three programmers with a lot of passion for software development.

We are great fans of the iPad and believe it to be a wonderful productivity device. We have been using our iPads for many productivity tasks, but the one missing piece was a powerful development tool that we can really use!

We wanted a tool that we could use to develop and reuse algorithms, explore math and science, build utilities, generate computer art, and develop stunning experiences that took advantage of the powerful iPad GPU.

Jasic is a tool we can evolve to be something you can use to build professional iOS applications, games, and cloud services.

With Jasic, we created a JavaScript engine optimized for the iOS. We made sure our engine was built to accommodate the strict security and deployment needs of iOS. We run all script logic on a background thread and ensure the user can terminate a script at any time. We limit what scripts have access to both at the API level and by restricting the permissions Jasic itself requests. And, the engine is optimized to run interpreted so it doesn't violate code generation security rules.

We built a complete tool with syntax enabled editing, debugging, and even basic profiling. We worked hard to make sure that our tool was modern and optimized for iPad touch hardware (gesture based debugging, navigation, accessory keyboard, popover context menus, and much more). We even built an amazing amount of file and folder management functionality (zip, email, share HTML, support Dropbox, iCloud, etc.).

Jasic was built with an eye to the future. While we all love HTML and its unique relationship with JavaScript, we felt that we should focus on usages of JavaScript that go beyond HTML. So we built a unique runtime that offers a reasonable amount of Cocoa user interface functionality, XML, JSON, and HTTP support using standard APIs, and we made a massive investment in WebGL and 3D libraries. Jasic became a great playpen for learning WebGL, GLSL, OpenGL ES, and more. We even used Jasic to build an easy to learn scene graph / 3D engine we call igloo that we ported to C++ and included as a built in library.

We built many samples and wrote a lot of documentation, including a unique WebGL class summary with all the functions and constants outlined.

We've done so much on Jasic that it is impossible to cover it here in full, but our journey building this unique product has been nothing short of amazing. Yet this is really just beginning...

We would like to invite you to join us as we begin the next phase of getting Jasic ready for the world to use. As a beta user, have look at our documentation and samples to learn JavaScript and WebGL. Then use the tool to create apps, utilities and algorithms you can use anywhere JavaScript is used (Jasic, HTML, node.JS, Windows 8, and many more). And, most importantly, let us know what you think of the product. We are eager to make Jasic the best place for learning and creating on the iPad and we need your help to make this a reality.

We can't wait to hear from you and see what you will build with Jasic
